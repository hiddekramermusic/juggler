/**
 * Incremental renderer for text that arrives by growing.
 *
 * Rendering a stream by re-parsing the whole accumulated string on each update
 * costs O(length) per update, which over a block that arrives in many updates
 * is quadratic — the reason a long reasoning block used to make the UI stutter
 * for as long as it took to arrive. This splits the text at Markdown block
 * boundaries instead: everything before the last boundary is SEALED (parsed
 * once, then left alone in the DOM) and only the tail after it is re-parsed as
 * it grows. Each update then costs O(tail), and a tail is one paragraph.
 *
 * A boundary is only taken where appending more text cannot change what has
 * already been rendered: a blank line, outside any open fence, whose preceding
 * block is not one that more text could continue (a list, a blockquote, a
 * table, an indented code block). Text with no such boundary — one very long
 * unbroken paragraph — simply never seals, and degrades to re-parsing the
 * whole thing, exactly as before. Link reference definitions reach backwards
 * (a `[x]: url` line can change a link rendered paragraphs earlier), so the
 * first one seen turns sealing off for the rest of the stream.
 *
 * The text is assumed to only ever GROW at the end. A rewrite of the sealed
 * prefix is detected by fingerprint and answered with a full re-render.
 *
 * Syntax highlighting follows the same split. A sealed segment is final, so its
 * code blocks are coloured as they are sealed. The live tail is not: a fence
 * that is still arriving would be re-tokenised on every delta, for tokens that
 * are wrong until it closes. Instead the tail is highlighted once the text stops
 * growing (see SETTLE_MS), which also covers the common case of a code block at
 * the very end of a message, where nothing follows it to seal it.
 * @module utils/streaming-markdown
